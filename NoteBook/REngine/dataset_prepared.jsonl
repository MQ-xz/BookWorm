This allows the bridge to determine that a path to the root bridge is still availableshould the primary path fail.If a port in the blocking state stops receiving BPDUs, the bridge no longer considersthe port to be a path to the root bridge. In this case, the port should no longer beblocked, so the bridge puts the port into the forwarding state.\"}"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" routing protocol\",\"completion\": \"A routing protocol is a means whereby devices exchange information about the state ofthe network. The information collected from other devices is used to make decisionsabout the best path for packets to flow to each destination network.Routing protocols are both protocols and applications. The protocols themselves sit atLayer 3 in the OSI model, while the applications that make the routing decision run atLayer 7. Many routing protocols exist, though only a few are in common use today.Older protocols are rarely used, though some networks may contain legacy devices thatsupport only those protocols\"}"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" RIP\",\"completion\": \"RIP is the simplest of the routing protocols in use today. While I like to tell my clientsthat simple is good, I don't consider RIP to be simple goodness.RIP broadcasts all the routes it knows about every 30 seconds, regardless of the statusesof any other routers in the network. Because RIP uses broadcasts, every host on thenetwork listens to the updates, even though few can process them. On larger networks,the updates can be quite large and consume a lot of bandwidth on expensiveWAN links.\"}"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" EIGRP\",\"completion\": \"EIGRP is a classless enhancement to IGRP, which supports only classful networks.EIGRP, like IGRP, is a Cisco-proprietary routing protocol, which means that only Ciscorouters can use this protocol.

{"prompt":"","completion":" OSPF\",\"completion\": \"In a nutshell, the premise of the OSPF routing protocol is that the shortest or fastestpath that is available is the one that will be used.OSPF is the routing protocol of choice when:• There are routers from vendors other than Cisco in the network.• The network requires segmentation into areas or zones.• You want to avoid proprietary protocols.OSPF is a link-state routing protocol. The metric it uses is bandwidth. The bandwidthof each link is calculated by dividing 100,000,000 by the bandwidth of the link in bitsper second. Thus, a 100 Mbps link has a metric or “cost” of 1, a 10 Mbps link has acost of 10, and a 1.5 Mbps link has a cost of 64. A 1 Gbps (or faster) link also has a costof 1 because the cost cannot be lower than 1. The costs for each link in the path areadded together to form a metric for the route\"}"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" BGP\",\"completion\": \"BGP is a very different protocol from the others described here. The most obviousdifference is that BGP is an external gateway protocol, while all the previously discussedprotocols were internal gateway protocols.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Redistribution\",\"completion\": \"Redistribution is the process of injecting routes into a routing protocol from outside therealm of the protocol.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Mutual Redistribution\",\"completion\": \"The term mutual redistribution refers to when a router redistributes between two routing protocols in both directions instead of just one.

{"prompt":"","completion":" VPN\",\"completion\": \"VPN tunnels also allow remote networks to appear as if they were locally connected. VPN encrypts all information before sending it across the network, but it willnot usually forward multicasts and broadcasts. Consequently, GRE tunnels areoften built within VPNs to allow routing protocols to function. VPNs are oftenused for remote access to secure networks.There are two main types of VPNs: point-to-point and remote access. Point-to-pointVPNs offer connectivity between two remote routers, creating a virtual link between them. Remote access VPNs are single-user tunnels between a user and arouter, firewall, or VPN concentrator (a specialized VPN-only device).Remote access VPNs usually require VPN client software to be installed on a personal computer.
